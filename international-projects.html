        <p> For this semester, we had to included international projects and there is a learning outcome about taking part it this
          projects. There were two projects in total and joined both of it. The first one was Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven with 
          guests from Canada. The other project was WeyWeyWeb in Malaga, Spain. The idea behind this project was to attend lectures
          there, because it is the very up to date information, which can be helpful. First, I am going to talk about the Dutch 
          Design week, then for WeyWeyWeb.

          For the Dutch Design Week, I have prepared a summary document, where I have explained what me and the rest of the group have been
          doing in that week. <br>

          Participating in the Design Design week was a dynamic and collaborative experience as part of my semester project. 
          Welcoming guests from Canada, we embarked on a collective journey to contribute to the vibrant atmosphere of 
          the Dutch Design week. The essence of this project lies in fostering collaboration among diverse students, 
          pooling together our unique perspectives and skills. We wanted to mix our ideas and skills to create something special. 
          This project was all about teamwork, learning, and making cool things happen during the Dutch Design week.

          Day one in Malaga for WeyWeyWeb was a fantastic start! We kicked off with an engaging lecture focusing on web programming
          and JS Frameworks. It was a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of these technologies, sparking insightful discussions and
          giving us a lot to think about. You can check the link bellow and see the process of these couple of project days <br>

          On day two, the excitement continued with another intriguing lecture, this time centered around web design and 
          mobile development. We explored the creative side of web technologies and dove into the world of building applications
          for mobile devices. The two days at WeyWeyWeb were an enriching experience, blending technical insights with creative
          exploration.

        <p><b>• Dutch Design Week Eindhoven</b> <br>
          Participating in the Dutch Design Week project was a valuable experience that significantly influenced my professional
          growth. Exploring different fields like History, Arts, Technology, Science, Education, and Health gave me a well-rounded
          understanding of design. Working with students from Canada made in even more special and emphasized the importance of
          teamwork and collaboration. This immersive experience not only improved my design skills but also deepened my 
          appreciation for the creative synergy that arises from diverse talents working together. The Dutch Design Week project
          provided a dynamic learning platform, fostering creativity and cultivating a collaborative mindset that will impact my
          future design endeavors. <br>

          <b>• WeyWeyWeb Malaga, Spain</b> <br>
          Going to Malaga for this project was really great! I learned so much and got updates on the newest things happening in 
          web technologies at WeyWeyWeb. It was like getting a fresh look at how websites and cool features are made. This not only
          helped me with my work but also made me feel positive and excited. Being around other students and professionals created
          a nice community feeling, and I left Malaga not just with more knowledge but also with a happy and motivated mindset to
          keep going in the world of web technologies.
