            (Main Research Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            In order to answer this question, I divided it by sub questions to help me find the answer. My sub questions are: <br> <br>
            
<b>1.	What are the key elements that should be included in the portfolio? <br>
Method – Best, Good & Bad practices <br> </b>

To be able to answer my sub question, I used different research methods. For this sub question I used these CMD methods: <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/Best,Good&Bad practises.pdf" target="_blank">Best, Good & Bad practises</a></b> <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/Requirements List.pdf" target="_blank">Requirements List </a></b> <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/Requirements List.pdf" target="_blank">User Stories</a></b> <br>

From these research methods I was able to  conclude that I need to make my portfolio user-friendly and avoid a lot of text in it. 
I concluded that my design must be responsive and I also figured out what mistakes to avoid like ignoring copyright, overloading with content and
not overusing animations and effects, because it might distract the user. 
Requirements list helped me prioritize what’s important in my portfolio and the user stories helped me gain insights of what user want to see in it. <br> <br>

<b>2. How does the choice of visuals, layout, and design impact the overall impression of my creative thinking, programming skills and progress?” </b> <br> <br>
For this sub question I used these CMD methods: <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/Trend Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">Trend Analysis</a> </b> <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/Design Pattern Search.pdf" target="_blank">Design Pattern Search</a></b> <br>
From these research methods, I was able to conclude what I need to be up to date with the trend since 
I want to show my creativity and programming skills. I already had the structure and requirements from the previous methods, 
so I needed to start thinking about the design. I was able to combine different styles with the help of design pattern search method. <br> <br>

<b>3. How can I test the portfolio</b> <br>
To be able to test my portfolio I used these testing methods <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/Interview.pdf" target="_blank">Interview</a> </b> <br>
<b>•	<a href="../research/AB Testing.pdf" target="_blank">A/B Testing</a> </b> <br>
From these research methods I learnt a lot. It helped me understand what users liked and would like to add or change. 
A/B Testing let me compare different designs and the results showed that one version was more engaging for users. 
So I decided to use that design for the final version of my portfolio. <br> <br>

<b>4. Conclusion</b> <br>
In crafting my digital portfolio, I employed various research methods to ensure a high-quality, creative and user-friendly outcome. 
I followed the best ways of doing things, made sure everything was ethical, and considered what users might like. 
Talking to users and trying out different designs helped me understand what they want. The final design was picked based on what 
users liked the most. Even though these methods covered many things, it's important to know that not everything can be predicted, 
and everyone has different preferences. Still, I worked hard to make a professional and user-friendly portfolio that meets technical 
standards and what users generally like. Finally, as I was able to answer my main research question I did an <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/LmR7UjQR41e2Wn4sHLl9KT/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=shzZdpwLDTBD8YSr-0" target="_blank">Interactive Prototype </a>
to display all the research and design and <a href="../research/Observation and Prototype.pdf" target="_blank">Observation</a>, so I can see how the user reacts to it.

          <span class="title">What are the key elements that should be included in the portfolio? (Sub Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>This was the first research question I started working on, due to the fact that the structure of the portfolio and the 
            content I want to display is the most important part. For this reason I used <a href="../research/Best,Good&Bad practises.pdf" target="_blank">Best, Good & Bad practises</a> as research method
            to find out what I should and shoudn't include in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finding out what I need to include in my portfolio, I needed something like a criteria for my portfolio to be able
            to give it a good structure and fill it with useful information, as well as step into user's shoes so I decided to set <a href="../research/Requirements List.pdf" target="_blank">Requirements List and User Stories</a>, where I list all
            the requirements that I need to cover and user stories that I would like to implement in development phase.

            creative thinking, programming skills and progress? (Sub Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            As a result of my previous research, it started getting clear for me what I want to build, but I didn't know what I should
            use to achieve my goals. Since I am Media student, it is important for my profile to show that I have creative thinking and
            should come up with some unusual approach to showcase it. I decided to check the trend and see what other developers are into, so
            I did <a href="../research/Trend Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">Trend Analysis</a> to help me with that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Trend Analysis method helped me out with the tools that I need to use to develop it, as well as to have good time management
            and be able to track my process. But it was time to start thinking about some design ideas of how I can showcase all of these
            ideas that I had. For that pursose I decided to do <a href="../research/Design Pattern Search.pdf" target="_blank">Design Pattern Search</a>
            I used this method to get inspired from some articles and take some good points from different projects and make my own unique one.

        <p>
            To be able to improve my portfolio and implement new ideas that I might have not think about I needed some method to help 
            me out, so I decided to test the portfolio and use <a href="../research/Interview.pdf" target="_blank">Interview</a>
            as research method. This method helped me realize that the portfolio could be taken to a further professional level.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had some ideas of how to display the content that I have made, but I needed a feedback from someone that might tell me 
            something I couldn't see. That's why I decided to test my two main ideas with my teacher using A/B test method and decide together with him which
            one fits better. Here you can find the full <a href="../research/AB Testing.pdf" target="_blank">A/B Testing</a>
