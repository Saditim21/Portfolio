            (Main Research Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            In order to answer this question, I divided it by sub questions to help me find the answer. My sub questions are: <br> <br>
            
1.	What are the key elements that should be included in the portfolio? (Sub Question) <br>
Method – Best, Good & Bad practices <br> <br>

Why this method? <br>
This was the first research question I started working on, due to the fact that the structure of the portfolio and the content I want to display is the most important part. I used this method, because I wanted to find out what I should use and what mistakes I should avoid, based on the experience of other developers. Click here to check full research document.

To be able to answer my sub questions, I used different research methods. For the first sub question   “What are the key elements that should be included in the portfolio” I used these CMD methods:
•	Best, Good & Bad practices
•	Requirements List
•	User Stories

From these research methods I was able to conclude that I need to make my portfolio user-friendly and avoid a lot of text in it. I also figured out what mistakes to avoid. Requirements list helped me prioritize what’s important in my portfolio and the user stories helped me gain insights of what user want to see in it.

        </p>
        <p>
            The next step after making the prototype was to see how the user is going to receive it, so I decided to use
            <a href="../research/Observation and Prototype.pdf" target="_blank">Observation</a> and see first reactions of it.
            I invited a friend of mine with decent years of experience, so that I can receive helpful feedback as well.

        </div>
        <p>This was the first research question I started working on, due to the fact that the structure of the portfolio and the 
            content I want to display is the most important part. For this reason I used <a href="../research/Best,Good&Bad practises.pdf" target="_blank">Best, Good & Bad practises</a> as research method
            to find out what I should and shoudn't include in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finding out what I need to include in my portfolio, I needed something like a criteria for my portfolio to be able
            to give it a good structure and fill it with useful information, as well as step into user's shoes so I decided to set <a href="../research/Requirements List.pdf" target="_blank">Requirements List with User Stories</a>, where I list all
            the requirements that I need to cover and user stories that I would like to implement in development phase.

            creative thinking, programming skills and progress? (Sub Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            As a result of my previous research, it started getting clear for me what I want to build, but I didn't know what I should
            use to achieve my goals. Since I am Media student, it is important for my profile to show that I have creative thinking and
            should come up with some unusual approach to showcase it. I decided to check the trend and see what other developers are into, so
            I did <a href="../research/Trend Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">Trend Analysis</a> to help me with that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Trend Analysis method helped me out with the tools that I need to use to develop it, as well as to have good time management
            and be able to track my process. But it was time to start thinking about some design ideas of how I can showcase all of these
            ideas that I had. For that pursose I decided to do <a href="../research/Design Pattern Search.pdf" target="_blank">Design Pattern Search</a>
            I used this method to get inspired from some articles and take some good points from different projects and make my own unique one.

        </div>
        <p>
            To be able to improve my portfolio and implement new ideas that I might have not think about I needed some method to help 
            me out, so I decided to test the portfolio and use <a href="../research/Interview.pdf" target="_blank">Interview</a>
            as research method. This method helped me realize that the portfolio could be taken to a further professional level.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had some ideas of how to display the content that I have made, but I needed a feedback from someone that might tell me 
            something I couldn't see. That's why I decided to test my two main ideas with my teacher using A/B test method and decide together with him which
            one fits better. Here you can find the full <a href="../research/AB Testing.pdf" target="_blank">A/B Testing</a>
