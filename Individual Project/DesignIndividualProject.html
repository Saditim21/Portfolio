            with a digital portfolio? (Main Research Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            To be able to answer my main research question, I devided it by sub questions in order to help me find the needed result.
            For my main question I decided to display my research outcomes with an <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/LmR7UjQR41e2Wn4sHLl9KT/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=iWUD5Tpk5B3AyfoZ-0" target="_blank">Interactive Prototype</a>.
            It helped me visualize what I exactly had in mind, that's why it was on hold at some point, because I put my main focus on
            developing it, because it was more challenging than I thought it would be. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step after making the prototype was to see how the user is going to receive it, so I decided to use
            <a href="../research/Observation and Prototype.pdf" target="_blank">Observation</a> and see first reactions of it.
            I invited a friend of mine with decent years of experience, so that I can receive helpful feedback as well.

          <span class="title">What are the key elements that should be included in the portfolio? (Sub Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>This was the first research question I started working on, due to the fact that the structure of the portfolio and the 
            content I want to display is the most important part. For this reason I used <a href="../research/Best,Good&Bad practises.pdf" target="_blank">Best, Good & Bad practises</a> as research method
            to find out what I should and shoudn't include in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finding out what I need to include in my portfolio, I needed something like a criteria for my portfolio to be able
            to give it a good structure and fill it with useful information, as well as step into user's shoes so I decided to set <a href="../research/Requirements List.pdf" target="_blank">Requirements List with User Stories</a>, where I list all
            the requirements that I need to cover and user stories that I would like to implement in development phase.

          <span class="title">How does the choice of visuals, layout, and design impact the overall impression of my
            creative thinking, programming skills and progress? (Sub Question)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            As a result of my previous research, it started getting clear for me what I want to build, but I didn't know what I should
            use to achieve my goals. Since I am Media student, it is important for my profile to show that I have creative thinking and
            should come up with some unusual approach to showcase it. I decided to check the trend and see what other developers are into, so
            I did <a href="../research/Trend Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">Trend Analysis</a> to help me with that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Trend Analysis method helped me out with the tools that I need to use to develop it, as well as to have good time management
            and be able to track my process. But it was time to start thinking about some design ideas of how I can showcase all of these
            ideas that I had. For that pursose I decided to do <a href="../research/Design Pattern Search.pdf" target="_blank">Design Pattern Search</a>
            I used this method to get inspired from some articles and take some good points from different projects and make my own unique one.

        </div>
        <p>
            To be able to improve my portfolio and implement new ideas that I might have not think about I needed some method to help 
            me out, so I decided to test the portfolio and use <a href="../research/Interview.pdf" target="_blank">Interview</a>
            as research method. This method helped me realize that the portfolio could be taken to a further professional level.
