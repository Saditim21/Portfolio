        </div>
        <p>For this project, we got a group assignment from Fontys and the first topic was to improve the experience of the vistiors
          of TQ Strijp environment. For this, we had to come up with a list of problems we ran into when we were in the area. 
          We made a small list of problems and together with stakeholders we picked the problems we found most interesting to research 
          and to come up with a solution. Each one of us picked the problem that they were most interested in and started working to 
          come up with a solution to make this better. The goal was to implement a food delivery system in the building. However, after the research was made, we concluded that we need to change the idea,
          because it was impossible to make some big changes, due to the structure and spacing of the building. We were very limited with
          that idea and started brainstorming a new one. We came up with the idea to improve the food/hangout socializing spots. The stakeholders approved the idea and we started working on it. You can follow the process down below for clearer view.

          <span class="title"><b>1.	How does the historical context of the school building influence the design, acceptance, and efficiency of a food delivery system? (Sub Question) </b> </span>
        </div>
        <p>We started collectively with discovering and listing problems that we have faced in TQ Strijp. Therefore a 
          <b>	<a href="../Group Project/Problems List.pdf" target="_blank">Problems List</a></b> was implemented. <br> After that, it was
          time to <b><a href="../Group Project/brainstorm.png" target="_blank">Brainstorm ideas</a></b> <br> to help us solve some 
          of the problems list. We came up to the conclusion that we are going to implmement a food delivery system in the building.
          However, to be able to know if this delivery system is going to work, we needed some research methods to help out. I started with
          research question and the first method that I used was <br> <b>•<a href="../Group Project/Literature Study Prev.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">Literature Study</a></b> <br>
          Through this research journey, I gained valuable insights into the history and potential transformation of building TQ. 
          Learning about its past as a hub for big companies and its evolving role into a high-tech campus was eye-opening. 
          The architecture of the 1960-1970s period, with its distinctive features, became a guiding force for our design choices. 
          Taking inspiration from the steel-framed windows and concrete grid, we incorporated a new frame to honor the building's 
          legacy. This process not only deepened my understanding of architecture and history but also highlighted the importance of 
          connecting the past with present needs. Then it was time to ask the user directly, if they need such an idea in their life in TQ Strijp.
          <br> <b>•<a href="../Group Project/Literature Study Prev.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">Survey</a></b> <br>
          From this survey, I was able to conlude that people need such food delivery system and would use it. The outcome was very
          positive, so we started thinking about how can we implement such a system. I decided to check some practices to help me out,
          so I used <br> <b>•<a href="../Group Project/Literature Study Prev.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">Best, Good & Bad practices</a></b> <br>
          From this research method, I was able to conclude that in order to have a good product we should have a user-friendly interface
          of the system, diverse food selection, so more people can use it, customization option, so people can add or remove product from their dish, etc.<br>
          However, it was looking very potential, but after constant meetings with stakeholders, we were wondering if we have the space for that system
          to work? Then, me and a colleague from the team started researching how can we use the space in full potential. We took the 
          ceiling part and came up with a document of findings and ideas and it is called <br> <b> <a href="../Group Project/Use of Ceiling.pdf" target="_blank">Use of Ceiling</a></b>
          The outcome of this research is that the ceiling can be used in a lot of various ways, but in our case we don't have the heights
          of the floors, so it was impossible to use the ceilings. <br>
          <b>Conclusion</b> <br>
          To sum up all the above, we had a great start with the brainstorming and problems list and implementation of our research questions, 
          but the outcome was that this idea do not suit our building and we should think about different approach. Then we started brainstorming
          again about different ideas and work with the space that we have.

             for visitors of the Strijp TQ University Building, specifically focusing on facilitating social interactions, 
             organizing events during school lunch breaks, and coordinating group food orders among students and teachers? (Main Research Question)</b>
          </span> 
        </div>
        <p>Since, we discovered the previous idea is not going to work, collectively with the team discussed what should the next approach be,
          so we came up with a main question and sub questions to answer and every member of the group, chose the one they preffer to work on
          and my sub question to work on was: <br>
          <b>2.1 What technological and logistical challenges may arise during the development and implementation of the app, and what
             strategies can be employed to overcome these challenges, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for all users
              at Strijp TQ University? (Sub Question)</b> <br>
          To be able to answer this question, I used again methods from the CMD and the first one was: <br>
          <b>	•<a href="../Group Project/Literature Study.pdf" target="_blank">Literature Study</a></b> <br>
          I decided to use this method again, because it helped me a lot with the previous question.  By understanding what challenges
          I might have, it will be easier for me to solve it when the problem comes. The other research method that I have used for this
          question is <br>
          <b>	•<a href="../Group Project/Proof of Concept.pdf" target="_blank">Proof Of Concept</a></b> <br>
          Implementing Proof of Concept for our app, I was able to conclude what features works and what needs fixing. 
          Me and my team were able to conclude our Target audience from this research, set a success criteria to follow, 
          project scope, set some requirements and timeline to keep in touch with the deadlines. As overall, this method helped a lot in development aspect of the project. <br>
          We also decided to make a <b>	<a href="../Group Project/MoSCoW.png" target="_blank">MosCow</a></b> <br>for our project and see what can be used. <br>
          <b>Conclusion</b> <br>
          After all, I can conclude that we had the needed findings for the structure, requirments and practices and now show it visually.
          We all started a figma file and started experimenting our first ideas. Give it a look if you are interested down below.

        <p>In this section, I am going to show two prototypes. The first one is individual and it is more like a paper prototype, but in figma
          and the second one is the collective one. Everyone was free there to make changes when they have some finding of how to make it better. <br>
          <b>	•<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/XxldZNrSPSgnWWYdryhlnx/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=XSsa63Ych8xpPytp-0" target="_blank">First Prototype</a></b> <br>

          These were the prototypes, that we used to test with our users and see if they are going to accept the idea. The outcome is that
          all the feedback was positive with this approach, because its original and will socialize people more.

        </div>
        <p>For the development part, I was the main developer in the group, so I needed to take responsibility for implementing the app.
          I have prepared a short <br> <b>	•<a href="../Group Project/Code Review.pdf" target="_blank">Code Review</a></b> to gain some insights,
          behind the app. I decided to use React Native for the app, because React Native is a smart choice for app development due to 
          its ability to create cross-platform applications, saving time and effort. With a single codebase, you can reach both 
          iOS and Android users, streamlining development and maintenance. React Native, backed by Facebook, offers a vast community
          and a wealth of reusable components, accelerating the development process. Its "write once, run anywhere" approach ensures
          consistent performance and a native-like experience, making it an efficient and cost-effective solution for building 
          mobile apps.

        <p>It was time to see if how people are going to react to our app, but before that we needed a proposal to give, 
          because we wanted a proper testing with investment in it. So here we prepared a 
          <b>	•<a href="../Group Project/User testing.pdf" target="_blank">User Testing Proposal</a></b> <br>
          The proposal was approved after couple of discussions and we started preparing for the test itself. We discussed 
          what needs to be done, in order to implement sucessfull testing and we split roles between the team. I organized the 
          setup like making sure there are pizzas and drinks there. Having different activities to do like playing cards, etc.
          You can check the link below and see how it went<br>
          <b>	•<a href="../Group Project/Final usertest.pdf" target="_blank">Final User Test</a></b> <br>
          From the testing, we all concluded that people love the idea. We had such a good time, all of the teachers complimented our team
          and the work we did to make it happen. As overall, I think this was one of the best projects I have attended. I learnt a lot and
          from every department. I can't wait to apply these learning skills in future projects.
